# Structure

## Agenda

-   Why Modelling?
-   Microsimulation Modelling
-   Lifetable Modelling
-   Summary

# Modelling

## Why Modelling? (1/2)

-   Simple representation of complex world/phenomena
-   Experiments are not possible or feasible (e.g. randomised control trials)
-   Explore alternative consequences using scenarios
-   Trials are short (intermediate end-points), need for extrapolation Cholesterol levels (trial) to heart disease (model)
-   Generalisable to other settings (age groups, country)
-   Synthesizing data from various sources
-   Informing decisions in the absence of hard data (recent pandemic)

## Why Modelling? (2/2)

# Microsimulation

## Definition {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Modelling technique operates at individual level (such as persons, households, vehicles, or firms)

-   Estimates how demographic, behavioral, and policy changes might affect individual outcomes; also

-   To better understand the effects of current policies

-   ![](img/aggregated_approach.png) \| ![](img/microsim_approach.png) \|

## Example - Transport PM 2.5 for Munich

![](img/sim_pm2.5_munich.png)

## How it differs from traditional models?

-   Individual level (such as persons, households, vehicles, or firms)

-   Autonomous entity - with limited learning/adaptability abilities

-   Local interactions impact macro/aggregate levels

-   Explorative that can be used for explanation or prediction

-   Resource intensive - even with sample population

-   Nuanced understanding

## Ingredients

-   Synthetic Population[^1]

    ![](img/ipf.png)

-   Social/physical space

-   Rules of engagement with other actors/environment

## Synthetic Population

-   Census population

-   Localized prediction model based on the most recent Census

-   Surveys (like a travel or Physical Activity Survey)

## Examples - using Bogota (1/2)

# Lifetable Modelling

## Definition - Lifetable Modelling

-   Two states model: alive and dead
-   Outcomes: life years, and life expectancy.

![](img/lifetable_prob.png)

## Input/Outputs

-   **Inputs**: Mortality rates
-   **Depicts**: Life expectancy at different ages
-   **Period life tables**: individuals exposed over hypothetical life course to mortality rates observed in one calendar year
-   **Projected mortality rates**: Simulation relies on *cohort life tables*

## Source of Input Datasets

-   All-cause mortality rate: National Statistics offices/Global Burden of Disease Study

-   All-cause mortality rate trends: National Statistics offices

-   Population for each cohort (can also be 100,000 or similar figure)

## Two-state lifetable model (1/3)

![](img/two_state_transition_prob1.jpg)

## Two-state lifetable model (2/3)

![](img/two_state_transition_prob2a.jpg)

## Two-state lifetable model (3/3)

-   Average life years without intervention: 6,362

-   Average life years without intervention: 7,005

-   Life years gained: 643 (7,005 - 6,362)

-   Caveat

    -   Probability of dying increases with age

    -   Morbidity is captured by proportional multi-state lifetable models

# Summary

-   Microsimulation

    -   Pros:

        -   Large state spaces and captures diversity/heterogeneity on number of variables

        -   May incorporate expert opinions

    -   Cons:

        -   Technologically challenging and resource intensive

        -   (Yet) unsupported assumptions

-   Lifetable Modelling

    -   Pros

        -   Relatively easy to set up

        -   Comparatively low data requirements and easier to justify using Cost Benefit Analysis

    -   Cons

        -   Only mortality modelling

        -   Typically based on annual rates
